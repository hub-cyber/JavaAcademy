Exercise (Mistiposdedatos)
Write a Java program to declare an integer variables, one float variable, and one string variable 
and assign 10, 12.5, and "Java programming" to them respectively. Then display their values on the screen.

Excercise(ConcatenarCadena)
Given two strings, a and b, return the result of putting them together in the order abba, e.g. 
"Hi" and "Bye" returns "HiByeByeHi".

makeAbba("Hi", "Bye") → "HiByeByeHi"
makeAbba("Yo", "Alice") → "YoAliceAliceYo"
makeAbba("What", "Up") → "WhatUpUpWhat"

Exercise (PareImpar)
Write a Java program to determine whether an input number is an even number.

Excercise(Calificaciones  Y  CalificacionesConSwitch)
Create a JAVA program to display the "text mark" corresponding to a certain "numerical mark", using the following equivalence: 

9,10 = Sobresaliente 
7,8 = Notable 
6 = Bien 
5 = Aprobado 
0-4 = Suspenso 

Your program must ask the user for a numerical mark and display the corresponding text mark. 
You must do it twice: first using "if" and then using "switch".

Excercise(TwoStrings)
Given a string, return the string made of its first two chars, so the String "Hello" yields "He". 
If the string is shorter than length 2, return whatever there is, so "X" yields "X", and the empty string "" 
yields the empty string "". Note that str.length() returns the length of a string.

Exercise(Operations)
Write Java program to allow the user to input two integer values and then the program prints the results of adding, 
subtracting, multiplying, and dividing among the two values.

Exercise (Pino)
Write a Java program that uses for loop to produce the output shown below (note that there are no spaces in between stars). 
*****
****
***
**
*

The program must ask the user how many rows to print out between 1 and 10 (5 in this example).

Excercise(NumerosMultiplos)
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. 
The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 100.

Excercise(doWhileSumNumbers)
Write a do-while loop that asks the user to enter two numbers. The numbers should be added and the sum displayed. 
The loop should ask the user whether he or she wishes to perform the operation again. If so, the loop should repeat; 
otherwise it should terminate.

Exercise 
Write Java program to allow the user to input his/her age. Then the program will show if the person is eligible to vote. 
A person who is eligible to vote must be older than or equal to 18 years old.

Excercise
Check which is the gratest number among three integer numbers

Excercise
Given 2 int arrays, a and b, each length 3, return a new array length 2 containing their middle elements.

middleWay([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]) → [2, 5]
middleWay([7, 7, 7], [3, 8, 0]) → [7, 8]
middleWay([5, 2, 9], [1, 4, 5]) → [2, 4]

Excercise
Create a basic class with a method, a constructor, an instance variable and how to instantiate it.
